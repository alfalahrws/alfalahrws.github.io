            <p class="text-center">
                Welfare and Charitable Trust is a charitable, social and educational institution that, in the direct
                supervision of scholars, is making all possible efforts to reach the disadvantaged and marginalised
                sections, know their circumstances, assist them according to their circumstances, generate and highlight
                self-esteem and self-reliance in them and kindle the flame of uniformity, love and affection in the
                masses.
                Year of Establishment : 2006 / 1427 H
                Officials:
                President : Moulana Gayas Ahmed Rashadi
                General Secretary : Moulana Mohammad Fasihuddin Nadvi
                Secretary : Moulana Mohammad Musaddiq-ul-Qasmi
                Treasurer : Moulana Mohammad Waseem-ul-Haq Nadvi
                Vice President : Mufti Abdul Mohaimin Azhar-ul-Qasmi
                Need for Establishment and Objectives
                (1) The teachings of Islam that are related to humanity, love, sacrifice and service regardless of
                religion
                and the cherished teachings that the Blessed Prophet (SAW) gave to the entire humanity through his deeds
                and
                through the Madani Society created based on these attributes and the efforts of Companions and great
                scholars of every period to practically implement these teachings- execute these in the context of the
                present circumstances under the supervision of scholars, so that the progress and welfare of humanity
                could
                be ascertained and these services could develop into a practical response to those who deliberately or
                out
                of ignorance, are constantly engaged in associating Islam and Islamic teachings with terrorism or its
                encouragement.
                (2) A growing disconnect between the rich and the poor has been observed in this era of rapid
                development;
                the well-off people, instead of reaching the actual deserving people are trying to evaluate the level of
                poverty of the community through a few fraudsters (most of whom are not deserving) who approach them,
                whose
                circumstances are dissimilar to actual and ground realities, due to which most of the deserving people,
                due
                to their poverty or due to non-availability of the means to reach the well-off, are found to be drifting
                towards despair and frustration for the education of their children and economic support and treatment
                and
                care of their dependents and at times, due to lack of adequate resources, lose their lives. Hence, it is
                the
                objective of Safa Baitul Maal to assess in depth the slums and deserving people and instead of waiting
                for
                the deserving to approach, reach them in person and know their problems and with assistance from
                well-off
                people, strive to provide various resources to solve their issues so that the marginalised sections move
                forward on the track of development.
